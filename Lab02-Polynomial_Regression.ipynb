    "# ðŸ§ªLAB: Polynomial Regression as a First Approximation to Non-Linear Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore **Polynomial Regression** as a simple and intuitive extension of linear models that allows us to handle **non-linear** relationships between predictors and the target variable. While linear regression assumes a straight-line relationship, polynomial regression allows models to capture curves by introducing **non-linear transformations** of the original features. This a great starting point for thinking about **model complexity** and **non-linearity**, and will also be a first approximation to dealing with non-linear problems. Subsequent labs will concentrate on more advance models for this, such as **support vector machine** and **neural networks**.\n",
